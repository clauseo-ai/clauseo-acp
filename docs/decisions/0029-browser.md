# 0029: The browser: agent-browser behind Clauseo's guard

## Context

Both agents get one browser tool: agent-browser's built-in MCP server, `agent-browser mcp --tools
core`, pinned at v0.41.1 (Apache-2.0), driving a headless Chrome through Clauseo's egress proxy.
The agent starts every MCP server itself, with its own environment. That environment can hold
`HTTP_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY` or `AGENT_BROWSER_*` values, which agent-browser reads and which would undo
the isolation: a cloud browser provider, the lawyer's Chrome profile, a CDP attach, a proxy bypass.
And agent-browser's own check on tool arguments still lets through flags and fields that change the
session, show a window, write files anywhere or load saved browser state.

So the agent never starts agent-browser. It starts `clauseo-mcp browser-guard`, which starts
agent-browser with an environment built from scratch and checks every tool call on the way in.

Source lines below are agent-browser's, at tag v0.41.1, under `cli/src/`.

## Decision

### The guard (`crates/mcp`, the first S27 pull request)

**The binary.** `clauseo-mcp`, package `clauseo-mcp`. `main.rs` dispatches on argv[1] through one
table of modes, which also builds the usage line; R24 adds `connector` to it. No mode, or any
name not in the table (case-sensitive), prints `usage: clauseo-mcp <mode> ... (modes:
browser-guard)` on stderr and exits 2. Dependencies: `serde_json` only. Plain threads, no async
runtime, no HTTP client; `crates/mcp/tests/guard/deps.rs` walks `cargo metadata` and fails if
reqwest, hyper, ureq, curl, rustls, native-tls, tauri or tokio becomes reachable.

**The command line.** Exactly `clauseo-mcp browser-guard --agent-browser <file> --cwd <folder> --
<args...>`, in that order. `<file>` must be an absolute path to an existing file and `<folder>`
an absolute path to an existing folder. The child's arguments are passed exactly as given.
Anything else exits 2 with a reason and the mode's usage line.

**The environment.** The child gets exactly this map (`env.rs`), nothing inherited:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `AGENT_BROWSER_CONFIG`, `AGENT_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` | from the guard's environment, set by the host; each must be an absolute path |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_PROXY` | from the guard's environment; exactly `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`, port 1 to 65535, no leading zero |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_SESSION` | from the guard's environment; 1 to 64 of `A-Z a-z 0-9 _ -` |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_NAMESPACE` | the session value |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_PROXY_BYPASS` | `<-loopback>`, so loopback goes through the proxy too |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_ARGS` | `--force-webrtc-ip-handling-policy=disable_non_proxied_udp` |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `600000` |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_MAX_OUTPUT` | `25000` (characters; see below) |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` | `30000` |
| `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY` (and lower case on Unix) | the validated proxy URL; no `NO_PROXY` |
| `AGENT_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD_PATH`, `_SOCKET_DIR`, `_SCREENSHOT_DIR` | `<cwd>/downloads`, `<cwd>/run`, `<cwd>/screenshots` |
| Unix: `HOME`, `TMPDIR` | `<cwd>/home`, `<cwd>/tmp` |
| Windows: `TEMP`, `TMP` | `<cwd>\tmp` |
| `PATH` | Unix `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`; Windows `<SystemRoot>\System32;<SystemRoot>`, `C:\Windows` when `SystemRoot` is absent |
| Unix: `LANG` | passed through when present |
| Windows: `SystemRoot`, `windir`, `SystemDrive`, `ComSpec`, `PATHEXT`, `ProgramFiles`, `ProgramFiles(x86)`, `ProgramW6432`, `LOCALAPPDATA`, `APPDATA`, `USERPROFILE` | passed through when present, matched without ASCII case, first match wins, each emitted once under this spelling |

A required variable that is missing or invalid exits 2 with a stderr line naming it; the guard
never falls back. Whatever the guard's environment says, the fixed values above win. The guard
makes the folders under `--cwd` if missing (`--cwd` itself must exist), through the crate's write
module, and refuses one that exists as anything but a real folder (a file or a link): exit 1.

Why each value:
- The proxy variables: `agent_browser_read` with a `url` fetches through the CLI's own reqwest
  client (`read.rs:206-212`, no explicit proxy), which honours only these variables. Without
  them it would reach the network around the proxy. They are Clauseo's own values, never the
  agent's.
- `AGENT_BROWSER_SCREENSHOT_DIR`: the default is `~/.agent-browser/tmp/screenshots`
  (`screenshot.rs:658-666`), and on Windows `dirs::home_dir` ignores `HOME`, so it would land in
  the lawyer's real profile.
- `AGENT_BROWSER_MAX_OUTPUT` has no effect on MCP results: the MCP server always runs the CLI
  with `--json` (`mcp.rs:2658`), and the limit applies only to text output (`output.rs:525-548`).
  It is kept so the value holds if that changes, and the unit is characters (`output.rs:36-59`).

**The child.** agent-browser starts with `--cwd` as its working folder, piped stdin and stdout,
and the guard's stderr; on Windows with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` (agent-browser issue #1644). The
guard starts it with `std::process::Command::spawn`, which `clippy.toml` bans because agents
start through the `process` crate: this crate may depend only on serde and serde_json, the child
is one fixed program, and the host starts the guard itself through the `process` crate, whose
tree kill reaches the guard and agent-browser. One `#[expect]` at `spawn_child` in
`crates/mcp/src/browser_guard/relay.rs` carries it. The guard exits with the child's exit code, or
1 when a signal killed it.

**The relay.** Child to agent: each stdout line is copied whole, bytes unchanged. Agent to child:
each stdin line goes through the filter, and what passes is written as the guard's own
`serde_json::to_string` of the value it checked, so the child sees exactly what was checked (no
duplicate-key or other parser differential). Both directions write whole lines under one lock on
the guard's stdout. When the agent closes stdin, the guard sends one request,
`{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"clauseo-guard-close","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"agent_browser_close","arguments":{}}}`,
swallows its reply, waits at most 10 s for it, then closes the child's stdin and waits for the
child to exit. When the child ends first, the guard exits at once.

The close is best-effort because agent-browser's daemon detaches: on Unix it is started with
`setsid` (`connection.rs:940-960`), so it leaves the guard's process group and survives the
`process` crate's group kill; on Windows with `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP | DETACHED_PROCESS`
(`connection.rs:963-983`), which does not leave a Job Object, so the job kill should still end
it (not verified). A daemon that outlives the guard ends after the idle timeout, 10 minutes.

**The filter** (`filter.rs`) applies to agent-to-child lines only, in this order:

1. A line that is not JSON, or longer than 16 MiB: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":null,"error":{"code":-32700,"message":"Parse error"}}`, nothing forwarded.
2. A JSON array (a batch): `-32600`, "Clauseo does not allow batched requests in the browser.",
   nothing forwarded (agent-browser drops batches anyway, `mcp.rs:673-682`). A bare scalar:
   `-32600`, nothing forwarded.
3. An object whose `method` is exactly `tools/call` (case-sensitive, as `mcp.rs:700-709`
   matches) has `params.arguments` checked whatever the tool's name. Arguments that are absent
   or not an object pass: agent-browser refuses a non-object before running anything
   (`mcp.rs:3967-3975`). Keys match exactly, as agent-browser's do (`mcp.rs:2264-2308`).
   - **Refused keys:** `session`, `namespace`, `idleTimeout`, `restore`, `restoreSave`, `restoreCheckUrl`, `restoreCheckText`, `restoreCheckFn`, `caCert`, `useSystemCa`, `clearCaCert`, `headed`, `screenshotDir`, `path`.
     Present with any value, even `false` or `null`. `path` on any tool: `screenshot.path` writes
     any file the process can reach (`screenshot.rs:626-649`), past the agent's own write
     permissions; screenshots go to the guard's screenshot folder instead.
   - **`url`:** refused unless it is a string whose trimmed, lower-cased value starts with
     `http://` or `https://`, equals `about:blank`, or holds no `:` at all (agent-browser then adds
     `https://`, `commands.rs:76-90`, `read.rs:151-165`). The refusal names the scheme when it is
     a well-formed one (`file URLs`), else `non-web URLs`; a non-string is refused as `url`.
   - **`extraArgs`:** must be an array of strings, each exactly one of the allowed tokens below;
     anything else (another flag, a `--flag=value`, a positional) is refused by the token's name
     before any `=`, and a non-array or a non-string entry as `extraArgs`. None of the allowed
     tokens takes a value, and agent-browser lets positional tokens through unexamined
     (`mcp.rs:2679-2681`).
   - **`extraArgs` tokens allowed:** `--json`, `--full`, `-i`, `--quiet`, `-q`, `--annotate`.
   - **Any other string that reads as a flag:** a string at any depth of the arguments (except
     inside `extraArgs`) that is `-` or `--` followed by an ASCII letter. agent-browser puts typed
     values into the CLI's argv, and "the CLI reads global flags anywhere in argv"
     (`mcp.rs:2659-2661`; the CLI's loop, `flags.rs:820-900`), so a `selector` of `--headed` or a
     `url` of `--session` would set them. agent-browser's own check admits allow-listed names
     there (`mcp.rs:2682`). `-5`, `-`, `---` and `- item` pass.
4. A refused request is answered with its own id:
   `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":<same>,"result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Clauseo does not allow <name> in the browser."}],"isError":true}}`,
   and never reaches the child. A refused notification (no `id`) is dropped unanswered.
5. Everything else passes: other methods (`initialize`, `tools/list`, ...), other tools' calls,
   and `allowedDomains`, which can only narrow.

A unit test in `filter.rs` fails when the two lists above differ from the code's.

## Deviations from the S27 brief

- `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY` (and lower case on Unix) are set, to Clauseo's proxy;
  the brief said none. The brief's aim, never passing the agent's values, holds.
- `AGENT_BROWSER_SCREENSHOT_DIR` is added; `path` and `screenshotDir` are refused keys.
- `extraArgs` takes only the six exact tokens; the brief refused only unknown dash tokens.
- New rules: the `url` scheme check, the flag-shaped strings in typed values, batches and scalars
  refused, the 16 MiB line limit, and the close request on stdin EOF.
- The child starts through `std::process::Command`, not the `process` crate (above).
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s row lists `tauri, tokio, reqwest, hyper, ureq, curl, rustls, native-tls`
  under "Never depends on", not "tauri, any HTTP client": the crates-table check reads only crate
  names there. Status is `exists`, the table's word, not `active`. The dependency test also bans
  tokio.
- `serde` is not a direct dependency: `serde_json` alone does the work.
- `AGENTS.md` lost the Map's comment line to fit the new `crates/mcp` line within its 120 lines
  and 8 KiB; `ARCHITECTURE.md` already says planned crates are in its table.

## Consequences

- An agent-browser bump re-reads its `tools/list` schema and `extraArgs` handling: a new typed
  field that changes isolation passes the guard until it is added to the refused keys.
- The guard never forwards bytes it did not parse, so the agent cannot rely on key order or
  number formatting reaching agent-browser (an integer beyond `u64` becomes a float).
- Child output is not size-limited: agent-browser is trusted to frame its own lines.

## Not verified

- Windows: compiled with `cargo clippy --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`, never run.
  `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`, the case-insensitive pass-through on a real environment block, and the
  daemon's end under the Job Object are unverified.
- The guard in front of the real agent-browser (the smoke test is a later S27 PR).
- reqwest's reading of the proxy variables is from its documented behaviour, not from a run.
